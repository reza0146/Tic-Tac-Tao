Let's play! This project implements the classic tic tac tao game. 
## Features
* This is a terminal game and the players need to interact with the terminal to complete the game.
* Each time a player selects a cell, the grid will be displayed and marked with an X or O.
* The game will announce a winner as soon as a player marks three cells in a row.
* The game is capable of recognizing a tie condition.
* If a player inputs an invalid cell number or if their selected cell is already marked, an "Invalid input" message will be shown.
## Instructions for playing
1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program and it lives in `ttt.cpp`. Compile `ttt.cpp` and `functions.cpp` together.
3. Execute the generated executable file (can be different depending on the compiler you used).
## Contribution instructions
I have some improvements in mind such as 
  * Adding color to the crosses (red) and circles (green).
  * Making the console mouse-interactive. Right now the players should put numbers for their selected cell.
  
If you find issues in the code or can think of improvements and cool features to be added:
1. Fork and clone the repository.

3. Commit and push
4. Create a pull request
6. Wait for pull request to merge.

## Style
